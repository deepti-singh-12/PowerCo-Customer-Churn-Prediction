# PowerCo-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Python-PowerCo – Customer Churn Prediction

## OVERVIEW:
-	The client is experiencing customer churn, resulting in lost revenue and reduced lifetime value. 
-	The objective of this analysis was to identify key drivers of churn and enable proactive retention actions.

## TOOLS USED: 
-	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## KEY METRIC:
-	**Customer Churn Rate** – the primary indicator of revenue leakage and customer disengagement.
-	**Customer Churn Rate by Price Sensitivity Segment** – the most critical indicator of revenue at risk from pricing actions.

## KEY FINDING: PRICE SENSITIVITY DRIVES CHURN:
-	Our analysis validates Estelle's hypothesis that December-January price changes are the strongest predictor of customer churn, with our advanced model achieving 33%churn detection capability vs. industry benchmarks of ~5%.

## ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FOR SME DIVISION:
- 1.	**Price Communication Strategy:**
        - Winter months (Dec-Jan) require proactive customer communication.
    	- Implement early warning system for customers with high price sensitivity scores. Deploy retention campaigns before price changes take effect
- 2. **Customer Segmentation Priorities:**
      - Focus on high-margin, high-consumption customers with tenure >2 years.
      -	Target customers showing declining consumption patterns. Prioritize accounts with multiple contract modifications
- 3. **Revenue Protection Opportunities:**
      -	Immediate Impact: 280+ additional customers retained per 10,000 customers

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
- 1. **Immediate Implementation (30 Days)**
      - Deploy early warning system for all SME customers before price change.
      - Launch targeted retention campaigns for high-risk segments and customers.
      - Establish customer success team alerts for predictive intervention before churning.
- 2. **Customer Segmentation Focus**
      - Target the High-Value Customers: Customers with >$2,500 annual value and tenure >=2 years.
      - Checking Risk Indicators: Declining consumption + multiple contract modifications
      - Price Sensitivity: Proactive communication during winter pricing periods with the customers.
